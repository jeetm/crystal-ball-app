Magic 8 Ball  Mock - Crystal Ball
================

<b><h3>Description</h3></b>
<b>Note: </b> j4mehta is another GitHub account which I had while I was working at Kik Interactive during a co-op term. I have transferred the repositories for the personal projects which I worked on during the time I was there to this new account, which explains why the account activity for jeetmehta seems less in comparison to the amount of work shown.<br>

The Crystal Ball app is an application which I created by following a set of tutorials available online, provided by <a href = "http://teamtreehouse.com/library/ios-development">Treehouse</a>. This was basically an attempt to start learning the iOS SDK, as well as the basics of Objective-C. I am trying to branch out in terms of programming ability as much as possible, and I've always believed that "learning by doing" is the best way to learn, so I began exploring iOS development.

<b><h3>Implementation</h3></b>
Currently, the app basically displays a Crystal Ball (the image was basically from Google Images, it was a scaled version of <a href = "http://www.google.ca/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&docid=gbb_oz0DciIwNM&tbnid=ORYnFkFSqy71fM:&ved=0CAUQjRw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidpit.com%2Fen%2Fandroid%2Fmarket%2Fapps%2Fapp%2Fcom.acmarket.crystalball%2FCrystal-Ball-finger-scan&ei=W5meUbPpHcLbrAG27oB4&bvm=bv.47008514,d.aWc&psig=AFQjCNFznzQdI6ZDa7W-71Jga9ezjDvKXw&ust=1369434829618317">this image</a>). The ball displays a prediction if the phone is shook, or if the center of the ball itself is tapped. The idea behind this is that the user thinks of a question, and then attempts the appropriate action to recieve their answer. There are approximately 20 different answers, all of which are exactly the same predictions as given by the famous <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball">Magic 8-ball</a>. The program cycles through an array of these predictions, and displays a prediction in random order.

<b><h3>Experience</h3></b>
The experience of getting to learn iOS Development and Objective-C was very enlightening, but I'm sure there is so much more that is out there to learn, and I hope to continue to develop and hone my iOS Development skills. Objective-C seemed confusing at first, but it really is a well designed language, and I want to get more strongly accquainted with it in the near future. Feel free to send any pull requests or constructive criticism and/or tips, I'm always looking to improve!
